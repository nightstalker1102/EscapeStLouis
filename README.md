Web Publishing Class Final Project
This website was a team colaboration final project for Web Publishing class.  The authors and designers of this website were Noah Drake and myself.

This site was published on Github due to the free web hosting that Github offers.  

We received an "A" on the assignment, for those who were wondering.
